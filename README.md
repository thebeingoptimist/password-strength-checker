# password-strength-checker
The Password Strength Checker is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed to help users evaluate how strong or weak a password is before using it on any account.
The tool provides real-time feedback and practical suggestions to improve password strength.
All checks run locally in the user’s browser, ensuring privacy and security.
This tool is intended for awareness and guidance, not guarantees.
# What This Tool Does
The Password Strength Checker helps users:
  •	Evaluate password strength instantly
  •	Understand why a password is weak or strong
  •	Identify common password mistakes
  •	Improve passwords using simple recommendations
The tool does not store, transmit, or log passwords.
# What This Tool Does NOT Do
For clarity and transparency:
  •	❌ It does not store passwords
  •	❌ It does not send passwords to a server
  •	❌ It does not check data breaches
  •	❌ It does not guarantee account security
  •	❌ It does not replace password managers or security software
Password strength is a risk indicator, not absolute protection.
# Inputs Used
The tool uses a single input:
  •	Password – entered by the user and evaluated in real time
The password remains in the browser and is never saved or shared.
# How Password Strength Is Evaluated
The strength indicator is based on common security principles such as:
  •	Password length
  •	Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
  •	Inclusion of numbers and symbols
  •	Avoidance of common patterns or predictable sequences
The tool categorizes passwords into levels such as:
  •	Very weak
  •	Weak
  •	Medium
  •	Strong
These levels help users understand relative risk.
# How to Use the Password Strength Checker
  1.	Enter a password into the input field
  2.	Observe the strength bar and label update in real time
  3.	Review the tips shown below the strength indicator
  4.	Improve the password until it reaches an acceptable strength
This process takes only a few seconds.
# Example Use Case
Before creating a new account:
  •	A user checks password strength
  •	Sees whether the password is weak or strong
  •	Adjusts length or complexity if needed
This helps reduce the chance of using weak or predictable passwords.
# Important Notes & Limitations
  •	No password is guaranteed to be uncrackable
  •	Strength ratings are informational, not absolute
  •	Strong passwords should still be unique
  •	Password reuse increases risk even with strong passwords
This tool supports better decision-making, not certainty.
# Privacy & Safety
  •	All checks run locally in the browser
  •	No passwords are stored, tracked, or transmitted
  •	No user accounts or permissions are required
The tool is safe to use on desktop and mobile devices.
# When This Tool Is Most Useful
  •	Before creating new accounts
  •	When updating old or reused passwords
  •	When learning better password habits
  •	As a quick awareness check
